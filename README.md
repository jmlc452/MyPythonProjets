# My Projects and practice

A couple of beginner projects here, listed from easiest to hardest :)

- `selector.py`: simply a random selector to tell me who to facetime! (deals with imports)
- `login.py`: a fake login that lets you look like you're hacking into some super secret mainframe lol (practice with if statements, imports, print statements)
- `madlibs.py`: madlibs! (practice with inputs, strings)
- `rock_paper_scissors.py`: rock paper scissors (practice with functions and if statements)
- NOTE: `random_madlibs.py` and `sample_madlibs` are madlibs that I created if you just want to play around with them
- `minesweeper.py`: minesweeper! (This project focuses on recursion and classes)
- `binary_search.py`: binary search! (This is a common searching algorithm which comes up in job interviews, which is why it is important to know how to implement it in code.)
- `guessTheNumber.py`: guess The Number! (work with Python's random module, build functions, work with while loops and conditionals, and get user input.)
- `hangman.py`: hangman! (work with the string and random Python modules.)
- `login.py`: login! (practice with inputs, strings,functions and if statements)
- `sudoku.py`: Sudoku Solver! (Backtracking is a recursive technique that searches for every possible combination to help solve the problem.)
- `player.py`: Tic Tac Toe! (This project utilizes the minimax algorithm which is a recursive algorithm used for decision making.)
